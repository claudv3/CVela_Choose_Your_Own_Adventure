            <p>Angie is a hardworking office worker from Sacramento that needs a little getaway to San Francisco for the three-day weekend. She doesnâ€™t go down to SF often and needs help from a travel advisor (you!). 
        What attraction should she explore to after she settles at the Ritz-Carlton? </p>
