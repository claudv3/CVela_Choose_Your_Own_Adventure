                <p>Angie arrived at Ghiradelli Square and she looked around the shops before enjoying something from the Ghiradelli cafe. One place that piqued her interest is Gigi + Rosie. Although the shop is targeted towards children, she couldn’t help but get some Pusheen plushies there. She then went to the Ghiradelli cafe and enjoyed a tasty World Famous Hot Fudge sundae.</p>
                <p>“WOW! This is heavenly!”, said Angie. </p>
                <p>Thanks to you, you have discovered her new favorite dessert!</p>
                <p>Where else?</p>
