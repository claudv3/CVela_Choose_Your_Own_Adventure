                <p>Angie arrived at Pier 39 and she saw the sea lions resting on the dock. She thought that they were very cute and they remind her of herself as she is also living a carefree life at the moment.  She then went to the Biscoff cafe to grab a Biscoff latte to beat the cold weather. She walked around Pier 39 some more, enjoyed the aquarium, and fell in love with the lively atmosphere. </p>
