                <p>After lots and lots of exploring and trying out new things in the city for the weekend, Angie wraps up her trip by biking down the Golden Gate Bridge and visiting Twin Peaks to enjoy iconic views.  Thanks to you, this is a fun solo trip after months of hard work. She admits she went a little over the budget for the trip, but it was worth every penny and moment. She doesnâ€™t regret spending a little more at all. She then gave you an amazing review after she has arrived back at her house in Sacramento.</p>
                
                <p>Thus, your journey as a new travel advisor started off strong!</p>
                <p>THE END</p>
