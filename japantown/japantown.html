            <p>Angie arrived at Japantown and loves the small park in between the malls. She loved shopping at Kinokuniya and Baby the Stars Shine Bright. Although the dress she bought is a little out of her budget, her rationale for buying it was simply because it looked cute. She loved eating at Marufuku Ramen. She was glad the travel advisor advised her to reserve a spot in advance, because the lines without reservation gets too long. She had an overall enjoyable experience at Japantown! </p>
