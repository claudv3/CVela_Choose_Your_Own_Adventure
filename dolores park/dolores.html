            <p>As Angie arrived to Dolores Park, she loved looking around the area seeing all the visible skyscrapers. She sets down her blanket, sat on it, and pulled out a portable, store-bought charcuterie board from her bag. Many new faces, particularly females around her age, joined her picnic as they were also vacationing at SF during the three-day holiday. Angie realizes how people in the park are very kind and loved socializing with new people. </p>
            <p>Where else?</p>
