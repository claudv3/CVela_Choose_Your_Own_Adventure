                <p>Angie arrived at Union Square and she liked the interesting architecture of the Apple store there. She then went to stop by the new Nintendo store there. She splurged a lot of money on the Animal Crossing merchandise. She then ate at the Cheesecake factory on the top floor of the Macyâ€™s building. She loved the view out of the balcony there. She then hopped on the famous cable car for further exploring.</p>
