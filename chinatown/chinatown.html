            <p>Angie arrived at Chinatown and she fell in love with the local, lively atmosphere. She went to go to the fortune cookie factory and found it fascinating. She got to go to the local stores around the town and loved socializing with the locals there. She took a lot of pictures of the colorful decorations there to post on her hobby photography Instagram.  She absolutely loved Chinatown.</p>
